1
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
DRUG USE ISNâ€™T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

3
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

5
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,125
You nurse your husband and work at
the store every day. Aren't you tired?

6
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:56,792
Isn't it a hassle bringing Vaka
in small amounts every time?

7
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,000
You're doing the work twice.

8
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:01,834
Just put it at my place.
You live with Sua.

9
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,709
Do you really keep it at home?
Where?

10
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,125
You really want to know?

11
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:15,751
Sent it.

12
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,250
You could've just
said it out loud.

13
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,777
- What's this?
- A customer list.

14
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:27,999
It's divided into blacklisted,
new, and regular customers.

15
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,354
You should learn it.

16
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,494
We're a team now,
don't you trust me?

17
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:33,971
As if you do, huh?

18
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:38,252
I won't tell you until I earn
my 200 million, so forget it.

19
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:41,291
Whatever, showoff.

20
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:55,876
- The leaves are still falling.
- And?

21
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:59,079
I've worked as a server
in this neighborhood for three years.

22
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,125
It's gone now, but I worked at
Mijeong Restaurant across the street.

23
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,500
But I only just noticed
this big tree today.

24
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:19,792
You know, I really enjoy
waking up these days.

25
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:24,846
Caring for my husband and
working at the store isn't tiring.

26
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,292
I can't help but smile.

27
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:32,292
Watching the leaves sway
feels like the world has changed.

28
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,917
Maybe it's you who has changed.

29
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,042
PROTECTED TREE
ZELKOVA, 294 YEARS OLD

30
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,697
It has the same birthday as me.

31
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:46,220
How's that possible?
It's 300 years old.

32
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:48,830
I meant the day
this tree became protected.

33
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,999
In a way,
that's when it was reborn.

34
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:55,083
People recognize it
and call it by its name.

35
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,918
It went from just a tree
to a protected tree.

36
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:24,826
You asked me
what I wanted, right?

37
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:28,474
Let's just say
there's something I want to hear.

38
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,083
What's that?

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,131
Well done.

40
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:37,275
Even without parents, a college education,
and a permanent job...

41
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,542
Well done, Eunsoo.
You're good at everything you do.

42
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,209
Sitting under this protected tree,

43
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:59,667
I kind of feel like
I'm being protected, you know?

44
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:10,417
EPISODE 6

45
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:26,416
Who are you?
What do you want?

46
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,779
Tell me.
Where's our drug?

47
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,426
Let's wrap up and call it a day.

48
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:43,918
Hey, working overtime
won't make the bag appear.

49
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,334
Go home on time.

50
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,167
Husbands coming home late
and not helping with the kids

51
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,709
are all grounds for divorce.

52
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:52,459
I heard detectives
have a 40% divorce rate.

53
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:53,880
Exactly.

54
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:58,341
Even among us, there's you
and Detective Park.

55
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:01,716
At least I remarried, okay?
Keep me out of it.

56
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,719
- It's true, though.
- Have a good evening.

57
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:06,459
- I'll be on my way soon.
- Okay.

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,834
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:09,626
Hey, come here.
You spoiled little brat.

60
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,167
- Didn't I tell you to educate her?
- But she's right.

61
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,751
You want a beating?

62
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:25,542
What drug?

63
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,999
You don't know?
Should I search the house?

64
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,085
Where could it be?

65
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:34,999
Where could you have hidden it?

66
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,500
Here? Huh?

67
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,709
Maybe in a place like this.

68
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,250
Bingo, found it.

69
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,600
Unbelievable.
How'd you even think of this?

70
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:03,918
You've been sleeping with it
all this time?

71
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:28,640
What about the money?

72
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,791
You sold some.
Give us the money.

73
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,109
That's all there is.

74
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:38,626
It was just... at the house.

75
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,918
I didn't know whose it was,
so I just kept it here.

76
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:45,377
You can take it all.

77
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:50,813
I'll never report on you.
I didn't report the drugs either, okay?

78
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:53,275
Then maybe we should
ask this one instead.

79
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,417
MOM

80
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,918
The number you have dialed
is not available...

81
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:27,417
Mom, I'm on my way.
I'll be there in thirty minutes.

82
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:28,999
How was Mr. Lee?

83
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,709
You're awake.

84
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,375
So, keep talking.

85
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,417
Put the knife down first,
then I'll talk.

86
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,610
- Talk first.
- Put the knife down.

87
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:04,504
- Who are you guys?
- Shut up before I stick you again.

88
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,706
Hey, that's enough.

89
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,034
Bro, what's wrong?

90
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,792
I'll kill you!

91
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:40,389
James?

92
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,901
Eunsoo! Get out of here!

93
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,521
Ah, you little thief.

94
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,045
You betrayed me first.

95
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,435
Donghyun?

96
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,818
Donghyun, why are you here?

97
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,584
Are you... Phantom?

98
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:31,083
Donghyun, please spare me.

99
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,015
I only used
a little bit of it.

100
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,375
Take it all, just take it.

101
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,709
I won't tell anyone.

102
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,834
Don't kill me, Donghyun.

103
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,000
Please...

104
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:52,999
Why did you bring that?

105
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,083
You never know.

106
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,842
Are you sure we shouldn't call?

107
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,292
If our boss gets involved,
it'll get messy.

108
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,131
We can handle it ourselves.

109
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,155
It'll be better.

110
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,999
MONEY-GRUBBER

111
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,999
DELETE

112
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,115
Let's finish this quickly.

113
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:48,963
Bro, what are you doing?

114
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:53,606
Please...
Please, Donghyun.

115
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,000
Take the money too.

116
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:59,918
Just spare me.
Donghyun, don't kill me.

117
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,914
Boss, what should I do with the thief?

118
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,209
- Kill 'em.
- Kill...?

119
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,512
They stole our stuff and sold it.
We can't leave them be.

120
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,876
We must set an example for the others.

121
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:17,802
Unless you and your brother
want to take the fall.

122
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:23,083
That's amazing!
Congratulations!

123
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,584
No, no!

124
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:18,584
Mom!

125
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:20,792
Mom, open the door!

126
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:32,626
Something must've stuck the door.

127
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,959
You're late.
Did you have a good time?

128
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:36,999
Yeah.

129
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:38,549
Why were you wearing that inside?

130
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
It's cold.

131
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,250
Is the heater turned off?

132
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:47,045
You should always have it on.

133
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:56,484
What happened?

134
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:01,709
Uh... I broke something.

135
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,408
- Mom.
- Yeah?

136
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,042
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

137
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,876
I didn't know you did housekeeping.

138
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:22,560
I thought you were
earning money illegally.

139
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:27,462
I'm sorry.
I should've trusted you.

140
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:35,334
It's okay.
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

141
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:38,090
But I'm not ashamed of you.

142
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:41,108
You're my biggest pride, Mom.

143
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,778
You always were.

144
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,087
Expecting a call?

145
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:42,375
No, I was about to leave.

146
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,209
Why so scared?

147
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,584
Hey, come smoke with me.

148
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:50,999
I don't smoke.

149
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:54,459
Just do as I say.

150
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,709
What's this, boss?

151
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:11,764
The leftover after paying
my ex alimony.

152
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:16,542
I don't really need big money.

153
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:21,083
You were looking for a loan, right?

154
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:23,999
Buying the house
on a stretch was a mistake.

155
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,667
I have to pay millions in interest rates.
Forget about the principal.

156
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,116
That's life, man.

157
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,584
I can't take this money.

158
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:40,147
You gave me so much
at my child's first birthday.

159
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,124
Wanna know something?

160
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:48,667
I've seen a lot of people quit,
both voluntarily and not.

161
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:53,303
There are a lot of temptations.

162
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,834
You work your ass off
and get paid little.

163
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:03,209
The criminals you catch can make
your monthly salary in a day.

164
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:07,292
It drives you mad.
It's unfair.

165
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,542
They know this
and try to take advantage.

166
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:14,542
Remember Detective Park?
He was barely cleared two years ago.

167
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:18,509
They planted money in his trunk
and screwed him over.

168
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:21,950
They play games with our lives.

169
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:26,216
Why're you telling me this?

170
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:34,459
These days, it's hard to succeed
in the right way.

171
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,999
Hang in there.

172
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:44,422
There's still hope in this world
thanks to guys like you.

173
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:46,453
I'll definitely pay you back.

174
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,000
Just find the drug bag.

175
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,880
Our whole team
might get a promotion.

176
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,999
- Let's just finish this bag.
- What's in it?

177
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,995
Two soju and two snacks.

178
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:13,999
- No, we need more!
- What do you mean?

179
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:15,999
We need more alcohol!

180
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,999
Come here.

181
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:46,898
It's okay, it's broken.

182
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:31,999
Use this.

183
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:06,959
You killed him!

184
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:38,735
Mom, can I have ramen?

185
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,043
I'm going out to meet
Aunt Yeoju.

186
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,834
Hey, Sua.
I had to leave in a hurry.

187
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:09,709
Apparently, there's some urgent matter.
I'll be back soon.

188
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,500
Can you get me some spicy ramen?

189
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,999
Okay, got it.
See you later.

190
00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:58,015
Tell me. How many are you,
and how much do you know?

191
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:01,874
You're so dead.

192
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:55,042
Get treatment first.

193
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,352
We're in a life-or-death situation.
Fuck the wound, okay?

194
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:13,832
Luckily, I don't think
their higher-ups know yet.

195
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,751
They were planning to report
after dealing with us.

196
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:22,876
I think this guy is the boss,
but he hasn't mentioned us yet.

197
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,228
Does that mean Donghyun
is part of Phantom?

198
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,380
We need a plan.
How should we deal with them?

199
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:35,067
Deal with them?

200
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:38,888
Yes, we can't leave them be.
They can't be locked up forever.

201
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,473
They'll kill us, okay?

202
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,125
Still...

203
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:47,999
We don't have time.
We need to decide.

204
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,999
The delivery truck
comes at seven, right?

205
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,834
This is difficult for me too.

206
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:04,053
If we don't kill them,
they'll kill us.

207
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,585
Do you want them
to get to your family?

208
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,751
SUA

209
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:08,017
It doesn't feel the same.

210
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,459
Everything feels weak
compared to Vaka.

211
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:16,450
Didn't he say he'd be here today?

212
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:20,375
You said he comes whenever you call.
Where is he?

213
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:23,098
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

214
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:34,167
I'm terrified right now.

215
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:36,542
I'll drop Sua off at her uncle's.

216
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,794
I'll be back.
Let's talk afterwards.

217
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,626
KANG HWIRIM

218
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:24,511
- Hey.
- Sup? Why're you ignoring me?

219
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,709
I'm dealing with some personal stuff.

220
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:29,459
You couldn't text me?

221
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:31,385
Everyone's here.

222
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:37,681
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking straight.

223
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,299
So when are you coming?

224
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:48,161
I can't make it today.

225
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:08,253
Bro. Bro!

226
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:27,428
Did you use it all up already?

227
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,209
It was quite a bit.

228
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,136
Are you fucking
calling me a junkie?

229
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:15,250
Hey! You think I'm like
those addicts?

230
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,999
Don't you dare get cocky on me!

231
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:39,813
Even last time, you didn't show up
and sent only a lawyer.

232
00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:43,999
How dare you?
Keep your priorities straight!

233
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:49,375
Listen, I can't talk right now.

234
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:51,921
I'll call you later.

235
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,959
What did you say?

236
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,999
Say it again.
I dare you to say it!

237
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,999
Where...
To the hospital?

238
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,542
Boss...

239
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:23,966
Shit, the bag!

240
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:25,944
Huh?

241
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,052
Shut up and get your ass over here.

242
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,751
If you don't come today,
you're done. Got it?

243
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:46,584
Hello?

244
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:48,918
Ah, shit...

245
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,375
James. Hey, hey!

246
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,959
You bastard!

247
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:21,792
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

248
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,000
Boss, this is Junhyun!

249
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:28,792
Things got really messed up.

250
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,673
Can you come pick us up?

251
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:40,667
We need the doctor
who stitched my brother's finger.

252
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,876
What the hell happened?
Where are you?

253
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,057
This place is...

254
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,959
Junhyun.
Hello? Junhyun!

255
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:54,755
Hold on, a car's coming...

256
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,999
Fuck you, bastard...

257
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,833
Thank you.
Be a good girl.

258
00:38:40,857 --> 00:38:42,000
- Bye.
- Okay.

259
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:05,667
I'm on my way now.

260
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,999
What?

261
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,852
The body came in early this morning.

262
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:30,792
Its clothes looked similar
to the ones on your wanted poster.

263
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,895
Similar, right? Lots of external injuries
and severe organ damage.

264
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:39,184
He died from bleeding
on the way to the hospital.

265
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:43,724
And the blood test
came back positive for drugs.

266
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,140
Sir, Major Crimes Unit 1
is transferring

267
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:55,709
the home invasion case to us.

268
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:56,632
Why?

269
00:40:56,672 --> 00:40:59,339
They found drugs
in the dead suspect's system.

270
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,777
Phantom's new meth.

271
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:18,288
After their grandmother died,
they moved between relatives in Ansan.

272
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:21,167
When the older brother became of age,
they moved to Seoul.

273
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,554
To get a job.

274
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,317
Huh?

275
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,731
That's them.

276
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:44,813
They're the ones who fought
James at the station.

277
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:47,407
Wait, are these guys Phantom too?

278
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,305
- Which one died?
- I think the younger brother.

279
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:54,083
The other one is still unconscious.

280
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:57,999
They don't know
if he'll ever wake up.

281
00:41:58,626 --> 00:42:00,716
Karma's a bitch.

282
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:20,651
Eunsoo, did you clean
the warehouse?

283
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,999
Nothing happened, okay?

284
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,500
It's all done.

285
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:10,340
Yeah, there was
a lot of dust piled up.

286
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,902
Make sure you act
like your usual self.

287
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:17,012
You sure are a diligent one.

288
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,417
I thought a cleaning company came by.

289
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,459
Good work.

290
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,999
By the way, any news of Donghyun?
He's not answering his phone.

291
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:41,626
Don't let the police or anyone else
connect you to that incident.

292
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:55,792
He hasn't shown up yet.

293
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:59,292
I didn't think he would
ditch us this fast.

294
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:01,999
Kids these days are unbelievable.

295
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,167
- Let me know if he calls.
- Sure.

296
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,667
Ah, hello.

297
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:16,136
Are you the owner?

298
00:45:16,558 --> 00:45:20,542
I'm a police officer.
We're looking for Hwang Donghyun.

299
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,596
- When was the last time you saw him?
- About five days ago?

300
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,834
But he hasn't been answering
his phone since then.

301
00:45:58,785 --> 00:45:59,999
So, you saw him when?

302
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:04,150
About five days ago.
He hasn't come to work since.

303
00:46:04,163 --> 00:46:06,525
- And Kang Eunsoo?
- Eunsoo? There she is.

304
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,076
We meet again.

305
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:27,999
You know Hwang Donghyun too?

306
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,542
Wow, is there anyone
you don't know?

307
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:36,304
Then what about Phantom?

308
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:48,593
Eunsoo quit?

309
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:51,999
The cleaning job? Why?

310
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:54,083
I don't know.
She suddenly stopped coming.

311
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,905
The work was pretty nasty, I guess.

312
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,232
I'll wire you from now on.
Don't come here again.

313
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:05,208
Why? Do I embarrass you?

314
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:09,250
Not as much as someone who
begs his younger sister for money.

315
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:21,500
The number you dialed is not in service.

316
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,999
Please leave a message after the beep.

317
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:29,310
Eunsoo wouldn't quit just like that.

318
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,999
I keep getting impressed.

319
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,182
Chairman...

320
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,999
Please, I beg you.
Just this one time...

321
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:02,834
I'm begging you.

322
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:05,999
Please, Chairman...

323
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:19,587
Eunsoo works at Sua's art tutor?

324
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:22,584
Yeah, I was surprised
when I heard it from Sua.

325
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:25,118
She was better off cleaning
at the club.

326
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:27,664
But a housemaid for Sua's tutor?

327
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:31,477
It caused quite a bit
of a rumor at school.

328
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,094
Fake, of course.

329
00:49:33,896 --> 00:49:36,358
Grapes are rich in antioxidants.

330
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:38,584
Try some.

331
00:49:50,626 --> 00:49:51,918
Mr. Lee?

332
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:53,500
Mr. Lee!

333
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,083
Are you awake?

334
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:08,250
How did you get here?

335
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:11,649
Why didn't you
get your wound treated?

336
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,417
Because it's an obvious stab wound.

337
00:50:14,822 --> 00:50:16,993
The hospital would've left a record.

338
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,999
So you went to school
in that condition?

339
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:30,584
You weren't answering my calls,
so I came by to find your front door open.

340
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:38,351
Why did you come?
We shouldn't be together right now.

341
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:45,027
The police came to the supermarket.

342
00:50:46,382 --> 00:50:51,131
Okay, so what did you hear?

343
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:58,552
When they took him to the hospital,

344
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:02,250
it had already been too late.

345
00:51:12,256 --> 00:51:14,046
That's actually good news for us.

346
00:51:15,598 --> 00:51:16,957
Someone's dead.

347
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:21,542
Did you think we'd just earn
easy money and live happily ever after?

348
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:37,542
This isn't a simple hit-and-run.

349
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:42,999
The tint is too dark to see through.

350
00:51:43,876 --> 00:51:44,834
No license plate either.

351
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:47,429
This was a planned crime.

352
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:52,250
If they're Phantoms disguised as robbers,
they're looking for their bag.

353
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,035
So, whoever they are after...

354
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,213
...must have the drug bag.

355
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,999
ACCOMPLICE?
MEDUSA CLEANER

356
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,999
KANG EUNSOO (42)

357
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:18,426
Hey, I have a question.

358
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:23,792
I saw my friend carrying pills inside
a highlighter. Where do they sell that?

359
00:52:24,613 --> 00:52:26,626
If you tell me,

360
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:31,197
I'll send you my nudes.

361
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:32,971
Wow, nice!

362
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:34,459
How old?

363
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,291
Highlighter?
Do you mean Vaka?

364
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:38,667
- Vaka?
- That's how they call Phantom's meth.

365
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:42,918
MINTCANDY22...
That's the seller's ID.

366
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:44,876
HASN'T BEEN ACTIVE THOUGH

367
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:49,459
Shit, the seller's inactive.
They've gone off the grid.

368
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:52,407
- I'll ask the Cybercrime Unit for help.
- Okay.

369
00:52:55,192 --> 00:52:57,359
Isn't this an opportunity for us?

370
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,883
We can pin this on Phantom more easily.

371
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:02,865
Just like you said.

372
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:07,296
Pick.
Is it them or your family?

373
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,626
- Both.
- What?

374
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:26,195
I can save both.
I just need to persuade Donghyun.

375
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:29,820
Do you really think that's possible?

376
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,905
Donghyun worked with me
for over half a year.

377
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:36,023
He's not the type to work
for some gang.

378
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,709
Maybe he was trying
to get out of Phantom.

379
00:53:40,104 --> 00:53:43,854
It doesn't make sense for him
to work so hard to get that big job!

380
00:53:45,198 --> 00:53:46,500
Then what about Phantom?

381
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:49,876
Say you convince them.
What about Phantom?

382
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:57,240
You saw the texts.
They have a boss.

383
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,500
They'll keep sending people.

384
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:06,713
The police...
What if we use the police?

385
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:11,125
If Donghyun tells the police
about the Phantom,

386
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:15,918
and make them get arrested,
we won't have anyone chasing us!

387
00:54:18,076 --> 00:54:20,076
A man was killed.

388
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:23,999
But that changes nothing.

389
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,792
We stick to our plan.

390
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:32,485
Besides, you didn't kill him.

391
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,668
And neither did I.

392
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:17,500
We've done nothing wrong.

393
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:31,908
Sir, could this be an internal conflict?

394
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:35,881
When I first arrested
Phantom's foot soldiers three years ago,

395
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:39,292
they didn't know each other
nor shared information.

396
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:41,489
We still don't know
who their boss is.

397
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:44,167
That's why they're called Phantom.

398
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:46,140
Keep going.

399
00:55:46,787 --> 00:55:48,650
It's the same
as with Kim Bongnam.

400
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:54,063
What if James,
the bucket hat woman,

401
00:55:54,468 --> 00:55:56,274
and the hit-and-run driver
are all Phantoms?

402
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:59,999
What if they're just fighting
to get the drug bag?

403
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:09,083
HWANG JUNHYUN

404
00:56:10,626 --> 00:56:13,000
The number you have
dialed cannot be reached.

405
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:15,751
Please leave a message
after the beep.

406
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:19,375
HWANG DONGHYUN

407
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:55,500
Chief!

408
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:58,876
We've located
Hwang Donghyun's phone!

409
00:56:58,999 --> 00:56:59,999
Really?

410
00:57:00,706 --> 00:57:02,539
Let's go!

411
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,500
BOSS

412
00:57:29,834 --> 00:57:32,083
HWANG DONGHYUN
BOSS

413
00:57:34,862 --> 00:57:37,209
He's half Vietnamese
and has been quiet for a few years.

414
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,334
He's got three prior convictions
for drug trafficking.

415
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,042
And now he's running
a noodle shop.

416
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:45,999
- Is this Hwang's phone location?
- Yes.

417
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:50,250
Then this bastard has to be
the hit-and-run driver!

418
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,209
DO GYUMAN

419
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:54,375
Let's ask him in person.

420
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:33,999
Eunsoo?

421
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:36,667
Yeoju...

422
01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:39,558
Why the shoehorn?

423
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:51,250
Sua said she went to her uncle's,
and was worried about you.

424
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,862
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

425
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:05,002
Wow, samgyetang!

426
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,999
- Did that lady give us this too?
- Yeah.

427
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:13,775
I just wanted... to live, you know?

428
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,167
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

429
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:18,999
AUTOPSY REPORT

430
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:21,584
1. DEATH BY MULTIPLE EXTERNAL INJURIES
2. DEATH BY MULTIPLE ORGAN DAMAGE

431
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:23,042
3. SHOCK AND BLOOD LOSS
4. BLOOD TEST RESULTS...

432
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:34,417
HWANG DONGHYUN

433
01:01:39,344 --> 01:01:42,584
I made this using
Korean native chicken.

434
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:45,167
So plump, right?
Try it.

435
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,160
Eunsoo, are you crying?

436
01:01:59,999 --> 01:02:00,999
What's wrong?

437
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,217
Eunsoo.

438
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:21,837
- If anything happens, call me.
- Okay, thanks.

439
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:13,046
My father always told me.

440
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:18,490
If you steal from others,
you'll always pay the price.

441
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:40,500
But for some people,

442
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:45,584
despite knowing the price,
there's a reason they can't stop.

443
01:04:59,513 --> 01:05:00,677
Who is it?

444
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:05,292
Don't worry about it.

445
01:05:14,907 --> 01:05:18,500
Didn't I tell you that we're done?

446
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,914
Fuck off, bastard.

447
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:25,542
The high doesn't hit the same, right?

448
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:27,292
Not like how it was?

449
01:05:48,346 --> 01:05:50,053
You'll be needing me again.

450
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:32,999
CALLER ID BLOCKED

451
01:06:51,723 --> 01:06:55,167
Whatever it is,
the joy of gaining something...

452
01:06:55,777 --> 01:06:59,818
...is always less
than the pain of losing it.

453
01:08:39,334 --> 01:08:42,334
WALKING ON THIN ICE

454
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:46,177
100 mil every week?
I have to keep doing this?

455
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,498
What was that you delivered?

456
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,626
I'll find the culprit.

457
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:56,250
We haven't figured out
how the Phantom has our intel, right?

458
01:08:57,312 --> 01:09:01,351
This is the blackmailer's photo,
and this is the one I just took.

459
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,626
What if it's someone around us?

460
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,292
What's with your face?
What did you do last night?

461
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,417
If they have both motive and reason...

462
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:11,999
Was it really you?

463
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:14,584
You're the money-grubber,
aren't you?
